      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <h2>This Is Just Some Hobby Website.</h2>
      <p>
        Big Damn MUSH is just a website made and maintained by randos who MUSH. If you host with us or use our service then we're not liable for any data loss, service interruption, or any kinds of problems that arise after using it like weird MUSH drama. This is a free hobby project, nobody pays to use it, and those who donate money to it are doing so out of good will and not any transactional exchange like extra services or consideration. I just want people to be able to fill out a form and get a game spat out, man. Don't sue me.  Cool? Cool.
      </p>

      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        You may be surprised that a random hobby website has its own privacy policy, but lo and behold - your use of our website indicates that you consent to our <Link type="inline" href="privacy">privacy policy</Link> and its terms.
      </p>

      <h2>Content</h2>
      <p>
        You are responsible for any content you provide and you are also responsible for curating your own experience in terms of upsetting content, like things you find emotionally triggering or inappropriate.  Please refer to our <Link type="inline" href="content">content policy</Link> and make use of our reporting features if you did land on something objectionable. We will remove content that violates our <Link type="inline" href="content">content policy</Link> and we will remove users who violate our terms of service.  Even so, any and all content is the sole responsibility of the person who originated that content.
      </p>

      <h3>Use the website as intended.</h3>
      <p>
        For example, just because we may offer a photo uploading feature, doesn't mean that you should use this website as a platform for indiscriminate image hosting. Some people can get real creative using website features way outside of the scope of their intended use, and if that's you, you can expect your content to get deleted.
      </p>

      <h3>Communicating With Other Users</h3>
      <p>
        Users have means by which to communicate with one another.  These rules apply to every communication medium provided by Big Damn MUSH.
      </p>
      <p>
        Comments become harassment the moment they are described as unwelcome and yet persist. When another user makes it clear that communication should stop, stop.  Continuing to contact that person in any way will be considered harassment and grounds for removal from the platform.  No exceptions will be made for people who claim to want to "just talk" or "heal this rift", etc., and no exceptions will be made for people who claim to be in a sympathetic situation (e.g., "They're my only friend!").  If your "only friend" blocked you, either you're manipulatively lying about how many friends you have to tug on our heart-strings, or you have a shitty friend who you should move on from.  In both situations, we still make no exceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any behavior that is typically illegal regardless of where you live will be considered grounds for removal.  This includes but is not limited to the following smash hits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Making a credible threat (as in what a police officer would deem a credible threat)</li>
        <li>Making repeated or harassing contact with an individual</li>
        <li>Impersonation of another individual in order to mar their reputation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Behavior that is considered toxic is also grounds for removal. Providing a clear and consistent definition of  'toxic behavior' is not possible, but we still reserve the right to, frankly speaking, get rid of assholes, even if they're using this platform to host a game, and even if getting rid of that person would effectively kill the game.  This is an unpaid service.  harass other users and find the door.  Users who are at risk of removal will first be presented in writing with the exact behavior that needs to stop including examples of when it happened so they know precisely what it is they need to stop doing, first.  They will therefore be given the opportunity to stop and make amends.  If the behavior persists despite the intervention, that is when we will kick you out for being an asshole. 
      </p>

      <h3>Big Damn MUSH may remove you for certain off-site behaviors</h3>

      <p>
        The online role playing community, especially when it comes to WOD mushes, is very small.  While tech like this endeavors to make our hobby more accessible to other users, it's still small.  If you're hosting a game on this platform, then you will be expected to be a courteous person who respects boundaries. Therefore we do, in fact, take into account off-platform behavior in the ways described below.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Revealing personally identifying information:</strong>  If you share personally identifying information that you obtained through our platform (for example, a naive user pages you and tells you where they go to school) then we will ban you regardless of where, why, or how you share that information in order to no longer enable you.  Don&rsquo;t dox people.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stalking:</strong> If a user draws a boundary with you (blocks you, tells you to stop talking to them) and you use another service to ignore that boundary, then we consider that stalking and we will therefore remove your access to our website's logged in features. We do not want to participate in somebody's continued efforts to disrespect someone else's boundaries.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Incitement to harassment and violence:</strong> As we do not tolerate incitement of harassment or violence, we will remove you for off-platform statements that encourage, instruct, or otherwise enable others to antagonize, malign, or physically harm other individuals.  Please note that while insulting commentary can be very distressing, we are under no obligation to take immediate action in response to insults unless they persist after intervention.  Please also note that while we will ban people who we deem to be a credible threat to your personal safety, we cannot actually protect your physical safety. If somebody else on the internet makes you feel unsafe you need to alert the proper authorities.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The list above is not comprehensive.  If some unforeseen and extreme circumstance leads site admins to feel banning somebody is in the best interest of the rest of our users, then we will do so.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        When removing users based on their behavior on other platforms, we will do our best to vet that these accounts correspond to the right people before taking decisive action.  We reserve the right to pre-emptively instate a temporary suspension of an account while we investigate a particular matter in order to potentially contain it.  That suspension will be lifted if we cannot be reasonably certain that an off-site account corresponds to a particular user. 
      </p>

      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        You represent that you have the right to post any content you upload. We represent that you own whatever it is that you upload to us - we just make it accessible to others online.  Big Damn MUSH is effectively a role playing platform that runs World of Darkness games so we make no claim of intellectual property period whatsoever, and that includes your creations such as your storylines or character ideas or other things you create, like drawings of your characters.  If you host with us and want to migrate to something else later you are entitled to a copy of the necessary data! 
      </p>

      <h2>Using The website</h2>
      <p>
        You agree not to abuse our website or attempt to compromise its security.
      </p>
      <p>
      We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information regarding your activity that is legal for us to keep in order to enforce the terms or investigate instances of malicious or illegal behavior. We do not disclose personally-identifying information to third parties. The only exception would be if we were forced to by law.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Account</h2>
      <p>
      You are responsible for safeguarding your account.  It is up to you to pick a strong password and keep it secret, keep it safe.
      </p>

      <p>
      You consent to us contacting you through email in order to help you reset a forgotten password, provide a service announcement, or provide a security alert.  If the contact information you provide becomes no longer valid, it is up to you to update your contact information to help prevent us from communicating with the wrong person.
      </p>
