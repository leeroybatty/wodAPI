      <h1>Content Policy</h1>

      <p>
        Big Damn MUSH is a platform that allows and encourages its users to express themselves through writing, which may cover any number of genres and topics, as well as to curate their own reading experiences and communicate with fellow creators and readers.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following standards are enforced by the admins.  Please abide by these rules not just by the letter of them but by their spirit as well.  These content policies apply to any form of content you upload, from character writeups to image uploads and the way you interact with others in OOC chats.  If you break the content policy, the surrounding context might solicit empathy from the mod team, but ultimately will not change the fact that you broke the content policy.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Respect the tone and culture set by the game you play on.</b> This website enables people to host their own games which will have their own game culture. Just because whatever behavior they ask of you is not in this content policy doesn&rsquo;t invalidate their expectations. Follow them. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Do not incite or promote violence, hate, or criminal acts.</b>  There is a difference between a depiction of bigotry, hate or violence and actually encouraging the same. Any comments made by people that themselves OOCly promote/incite such concepts are unacceptable, period, point blank.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Your content should belong to you, period, or else be uploaded with the creator's explicit permission.</b> Content that you upload which was created by an uninvolved third party will be removed if we discover that it it was uploaded without the consent of the creator(s).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Respect the privacy of others.</b>  We will not tolerate any sharing or posting any content that includes personally identifiable information (PII) without explicit, written consent. This includes pictures, names, addresses and email addresses, peoples' workplaces, schools, birthdates, and literally any other private information. Any violation of this rule will result in the immediate removal of the content upon its discovery. If the consent is given by a minor, it doesn't meet our criteria for consent. No exceptions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Do not enable piracy on this platform.</b> No links to places where you can pirate the content, no PDF uploads, no word by word copy pasting of entire passages of WOD book content.  Paraphrasing mechanics and how it works is fine but listen man, I did not put this website together to get cease and desisted. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>No sexual content involving minors, no games allowing characters under the age of 18.</b> And don't give me this &ldquo;but they're actually a 3000-year-old dragon &rdquo; shit.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Obey the law.</b>  Posting illegal content or soliciting or facilitating illegal activity is grounds for an immediate ban from the website.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Do not link to off-site content that violates our content policy.</b> We will remove it as well as remove users who repeatedly violate this rule. 
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>We enforce our content policy the following ways depending on the circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Asking you to remove the offending material within a time frame yourself before we remove it for you</li>
        <li>Removing it for you and issuing a first and final warning</li>
        <li>Removing your account privileges if you continue to violate the policy in ways that do not result in a ban</li>
        <li>Banning you because this is a free platform and it's banning time</li>
      </ul>
